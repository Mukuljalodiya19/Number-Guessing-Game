# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a console-based java application. This project demonstrate the practical implementation of core java programming concepts through an interactive and user-friendly game. The system randomly generates a number within a predefined range (from 1 to 100). The player is promoted to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. after each guess, thr program provides feedback indicating that thr number is too high, too low, or correct. To make the game more engaging, the application restricts the total number of attempts, encouraging logical thinking and efficient guessing strategies. once tge game round is completed--either by guessing the correct number or exhausting all attempts--the user is given the option to play again.
